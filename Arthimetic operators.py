the operators are:
+,-,*,/,//,%,**
NOTE:input() is a function which takes input from user
code 
"""
a=int(input("enter a number:"))
b=int(input("enter a number:"))  
print("the addition",a+b)
print("the subtraction",a-b)
print("the multiplication",a*b)
print("the division",a/b)#which returns the  quotient 
print("the floordivision",a//b)#which returns the integral quotient part in a division
print("the modulardivision",a%b)#which returns the remainder part before the decimal
print("the power",a**b)#which returns the power`
